# Fortune Teller

## I had issues combining the ${name} and  ${age} fortune lines. The ${name} fortune lines returned until I added the functions for the ${age} function fortune lines. Then ONLY the ${age} foturne lines returned. To solve this issue I had to reach out to Jennifer (T.A.) and we collaborated and decided to add let nameFortune =""; and  let ageFortune =""; variables. In addtion we substituted "else if" conditions to pause the code instead of having "if" condtions run throughout the code. This solved the issue and returned the combined fortune lines for nameWithAge.
